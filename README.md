# QupRankedBot
Discord bot designed to facilitate ranked PvP matches in Final Fantasy XIV.  Written using Python, PostgreSQL, and actively running on a Raspberry Pi on my desk.  I had very little experience with Python before I started, and was able to learn as I went, including the use of various 3rd party APIs such as Discord's own API for bots, Psycopg2 for PostgreSQL implementation, and pytz to use with datetime features to track relevant timestamps.  This bot can be found at discord.gg/pvprevival, Final Fantasy XIV's largest PvP-oriented Discord community with over 36,000 members, where I serve as one of the two owners.

Future improvements would include the ability to function properly across multiple Discord servers, and cloud hosting to upgrade from the Raspberry Pi.
